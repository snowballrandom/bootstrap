Bootstrap CSS With Full Glyphs

This is a the css to add to your bootstrap.css file. It is the css for use with the full version of 
Glyphicons found @ https://glyphicons.com/

Just replace the portion of your orignal bootstrap.css file that contains the glyphicons css with the css in this one and copy your font files that you received with your paid version of Glyphicons to your font directory and edit the location inside the bootstrap.css file around line 263 with the location of your font files. Thats It!

The Font files should be:

glyphicons-regular.eot

glyphicons-regular.svg

glyphicons-regular.ttf

glyphicons-regular.woff

glyphicons-regular.woff2
