Bootstrap CSS With Full Glyphs

This is a modified css file of the bootstrap.css file that has the css for use with the full version of Glyphicons found @ https://glyphicons.com/

Just replace your orignal bootstrap.css file with this one and copy your font files that you received with your paid version of Glyphicons to your font directory and edit the location inside the bootstrap.css file around line 263.

The Font files should be:

./fonts/glyphicons-regular.eot
./fonts/glyphicons-regular.svg
./fonts/glyphicons-regular.ttf
./fonts/glyphicons-regular.woff
./fonts/glyphicons-regular.woff2
