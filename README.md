Bootstrap CSS With Full Glyphs

This is a modified css file of the bootstrap.css file that has the css for use with the full version of Glyphicons found @ https://glyphicons.com/

Just replace your orignal bootstrap.css file with this one and copy your font files that you received with your paid version of Glyphicons to your font directory and edit the location inside the bootstrap.css file around line 263 with the location of your font files. Thats It!

The Font files should be:

glyphicons-regular.eot

glyphicons-regular.svg

glyphicons-regular.ttf

glyphicons-regular.woff

glyphicons-regular.woff2


I have an answer I posted on Stackoverflow that you can use as to how to do this manualy: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20344363/add-all-glyphicons-to-bootstrap-3/44346819#44346819
